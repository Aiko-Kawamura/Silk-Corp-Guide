Through this program, we will develop a new initiative known as The Silk Women™
Cooperative where we train women in rural areas fine arts, crafts, and entrepreneurship to 
create bracelets, necklaces, pottery, fashion and many other items which all will be handmade. Our NGO will handle all branding, logistics, and retail distribution in the USA for 
the Cooperative through multiple partnerships to ensure the women can create sustainable 
incomes and livelihoods. Our strategy allows women to focus on family first while still
playing an integral part of the economy with their own micro-business. 

PAKISTAN LEADERSHIP COLLABORATION

We are partnered with many leaders throughout Pakistan and other 
MENAP Countries and will create stronger ties with the Ministry of 
Federal Education & Professional Training, the Population Welfare 
Department, multiple Imams, city developers in the regions of 
Chitral, Peshawar, Gilgit, Karachi, Islamabad, and other prominent 
areas our programs will touch. 
Their role is crucial by endorsing our vision with resources for 
the Silk Women™ program to impression a large audience.

THE SILK WOMEN™ COOPERATIVE
In a new Era for the MENAP Region, we are developing The Silk Women™ Cooperative 
where we empower women internationally to come together with thousands of microbusinesses all under one vision and one brand to unite their goals of empowering one 
another and bringing new sustainable energy for their families. This initiative will see 
our leaders in arts, crafts, business, and e-commerce across the globe work together to 
create a new chapter for the villages of rural Pakistan. We will take this a step further 
and mentor the participants with wholesome values and family strategy for ongoing 
success.
